# Linkedin-Leadgen
Linkedin lead generation and outreach automation using n8n and apify.

This repository contains a complete **n8n workflow** designed to automate B2B lead generation and cold outreach using data directly submitted through a Google Form. The system fetches job listings, enriches them with contact info, and sends out personalized cold emails.

---

## ‚úÖ How It Works

1. **Google Form** collects input from the user:
   - LinkedIn job search URL (with filters like title, location, job type, etc.)
   - Agency/business name
   - Services offered
   - Contact details

2. **Google Sheet** stores the submitted responses.

3. **n8n Workflow** is triggered when a new row is added to the sheet:
   - Scrapes job and company data using Apify scrapers
   - Finds potential decision-makers using 3rd-party APIs
   - Prioritizes HR/Manager-level contacts
   - Generates highly tailored cold emails using llama & deepseek LLMs
   - Sends emails using **Gmail SMTP via OAuth**
   - Logs results + handles retries and errors
